## 🧭 Engineering Philosophy

I approach software development with a **product-first and systems-thinking mindset**. My focus is not only on making things work, but on making them **scalable, maintainable, observable, and deployable in real-world environments**.

I enjoy bridging the gap between **development and deployment** — designing full-stack applications, containerizing them, automating pipelines, and deploying them to the cloud with reliability in mind.

## 🛠 What I’m Actively Engineering

* **Algorithmic problem-solving systems** using Java (performance-focused DSA)
* **Production-grade MERN applications** with authentication, role-based access, and REST APIs
* **Containerized microservices** using Docker
* **Cloud-native deployments** on AWS
* **Infrastructure-aware applications** designed for scaling and monitoring

## 🧩 Areas of Deep Focus

### ⚙️ Software Engineering

* Data Structures & Algorithms (time/space optimization, patterns)
* Object-Oriented Design & Clean Architecture
* RESTful API design & backend scalability
* State management and component architecture in React

### 🌐 Full-Stack Development (MERN)

* MongoDB schema design & indexing
* Express.js middleware & API security
* React (Hooks, reusable components, performance tuning)
* End-to-end application workflows

### ☁️ Cloud, DevOps & Deployment

* **Docker**: Multi-stage builds, optimized images, container networking
* **Kubernetes**: Pods, Services, Deployments, basic Helm concepts
* **AWS**:

  * EC2 for compute
  * S3 for storage
  * IAM for access control
  * Basic VPC & networking understanding
* CI/CD concepts (automated builds, test & deploy pipelines)
* Deployment strategies (blue-green, rolling deployments – conceptual)
